# Tower-of-Hanoi-game
Tower of Hanoi is a classic puzzle with three rods and a stack of disks. The goal is to move the entire stack from one rod to another, following three rules: you can only move one disk at a time, you cannot place a larger disk on a smaller one, and you aim to do it in the fewest moves possible. It's a simple yet challenging game .
